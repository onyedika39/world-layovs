World Layovs Analysis with SQL
## Overview
This project involves analyzing global layoff trends using SQL. The dataset contains information about layovs across various industries, companies, and regions. The aim of this project is to uncover insights related to the frequency, distribution, and impact of layoffs in the global job market. By leveraging SQL queries, we explore patterns, trends, and correlations between different factors such as company size, industry, and the economic climate.

## Project Objectives
To analyze layovs by industry, region, and company size.
To track the changes in layoffs over time and identify potential correlations with economic events.
To provide insights into which sectors and companies are most affected by layoffs.
## Data
The dataset contains the following fields:

Company Name: Name of the company affected by layoffs.
Industry: Industry in which the company operates.
Region: Geographic region where the layoffs occurred.
Layovs Count: The number of employees laid off.
Date of Layoff: The date when the layoffs were announced.
Reason: Reason behind the layovs (e.g., downsizing, restructuring).
## Technologies Used
SQL for data querying and analysis.
SQL Server or MySQL for database management.
## Key Queries

## Insights and Results
The tech industry saw the largest number of layoffs over the past few years, especially in 2023.
North America experienced the highest number of layoffs, with significant spikes during certain periods.
Smaller companies were more likely to experience layoffs compared to large corporations.
The layoffs are often correlated with broader economic downturns and market instability.
## Conclusion
This analysis highlights the importance of understanding the global trends in layoffs. By using SQL, we can efficiently query large datasets to extract meaningful insights that can help businesses and policymakers make informed decisions in response to changing economic conditions.

## Future Work
Incorporating external factors like economic indicators and GDP data to further explore the relationship between economic performance and layoffs.
Analyzing the long-term impact of layoffs on affected workers and industries.
Extending the analysis to include global trends and their effect on labor markets.
